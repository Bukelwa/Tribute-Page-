					&ensp;
					<div class="black-text">
						<h4> Zola Pieterse (Budd) was born 1966 in Bloemfontein, South Africa. She became known to the athlets' world in the 80's after she ran the women's 5000m marathon barefoot and broke the world record at the age of 17.
							The shy, slightly-built Budd excelled in distances from the 1500m to the 10000m, but wasn’t able to compete internationally because of the apartheid policies of the South African government.
						</h4>
	<hr>
						<h4> After Budd had realised her ambition and passion in Olymic games, she applied for British citizenship on the ground that she had a british grandfather. The Daily Mail pushed her case and her citizenship was rushed through, allowing her to qualify to represent Britain in the 3000m marathon in Los Angeles.
						In South Africa today, township taxis are nicknamed Zola Budd, because they are as fast as Budd.

						<center><div class="box-container">
							<center><b>These are the highlights of her career</b></center>
						<ul>
						<li>In 1985 and 1986 she came first place in the World Cross Championship and Europian Cup.</li>
						<li>In 2007 she came first place in the Kloppers Marathon.</li>
						<li>In 2014 she came first place in the Charleston Marathon.</li>
						<li>In 2015 she came first place in the Run Hard Columbia Marathon.</li>
						<li>In 2012 she came thrid place in the Myrtle Beach Marathon.</li>
						</ul></div></center>
						</h4>
	<hr>
						<h4><div>After the most dramatic race in the Los Angeles Games, Budd was labelles as a villian after she bumped into Mary Decker-Slaney during the race. Budd was disqualified. This tarnished her reutation, because, even though there was proof that she didn't interntionally bump into Mary, people beleived that she did. After the incident Budd continued to compete for Britain for a number of years. She was crowned European 3000m champion in 1985 and set a world record of 14:48:07 in the 50000m.</div>
						&ensp;
						&ensp;
						&ensp;
						<div>Budd remains the holder of numerous British and South African records, both at junior and senior levels. She married in 1989 and today is Zola Pieterse, mother of three children. </div>
						&ensp;
						&ensp;
						&ensp;
						<div> Quizzed about her experience at the Olympics in 1984, Pieterse said recently: “It’s like reading a novel about a totally different person. I think, ‘That didnt happen to me?'”</div></h4>

							<h4><em> "Coming from a farming background, I saw nothing out of the ordinary in running barefoot, although it seemed to startle the rest of the athletics world. I have always enjoyed going barefoot and when I was growing up I seldom wore shoes, even when I went into town."</em></h4></center>
